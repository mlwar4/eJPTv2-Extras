These paths will help you alot in your eJPTv2 exam and I would recommend this before or after INE's course tho I don't like INE's course because most of the things will not come in the exam or it will be too easy for the exam. I don't recommend just studying from INE.
I would recommend tryhackme's Comptia Pentest + path would also help you alot .
